            The what and the why.
          </p>
          <p>
            PQ is a platform designed to promote well-being and an active lifestyle within corporate organisations. Colleagues create 
            teams and record physical activites which are converted into PQ Points. These points are tracked and celebrated across various 
            leaderboards, with the top individuals and teams being invited to a physical corporate experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a focus on inclusivity, PQ allows everyone in an organisation to compete on a level playing field; no matter your fitness level, 
            PQ is designed to be engaging and rewarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The web-application is a technically involved platform, with multiple systems working in harmony allowing users to connect their preferred tracking 
            devices (Garmin, Strava, etc.) and provide a seamless experience across desktop and mobile.

            Discovering the needs of the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to gauge the interest and discover the potential market for the platform a number of discussions took place with organisations of 
            varying sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst the basis of the conversation was structured around a questionnaire, it was vital the discussion was kept open and natural to ensure the true 
            needs of the companies could be discovered. This was achieved by using techniques such as 'The 5 Whys' to help determine what the real problems related to 
            employee wellbeing were/are.
          </p>
          <p>
            The insights of these conversations were then organised into categories such as 'problems', 'existing solutions' and 'success metrics', which would come together 
            to help us define what a successful project would consist of.

          </p>
          <p>
            With the information we gathered from the user interviews a list of requirements was compiled. These requirements were then filtered down and prioritised 
            using the MoSCoW method.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the requirements were scoped out, they were then translated into user stories to ensure the end user was always at the focus of development sprints.

            Initial designs and prototyping.

          <p>
            Wireframes were created in Adobe XD and turned into prototypes for testing user journeys and high-level page structure.

          </p>
          <p>
            With the basic layout and structure confirmed from the wireframe testing, the designs were then refined and 
            high-fidelity mock-ups were created.
          </p>
          <p>
            These mock-ups were essentially fully-functioning prototypes that allowed the wider team to test user flows, ensure 
            information hierarchy was correct and finalise which features were on the critical path (and which could be held back for 
            later development sprints).

            level impacted employee stress.

            As part of the design process, responsive implementations were considered from the very beginning. Due to the fact the PQ platform would 
            solely exist as a web application, it was vital that the mobile experience was just as seamless as the desktop one.

            Continuous delivery and testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following an Agile methodology, the platform was built using the user stories as a basis for sprints. Weekly releases 
            meant that progress was always visible and changes were being testing right from the beginning of the development period.
          </p>
          <p>
            As and when problems were discovered or potential improvements were thought of, the designs were revisited to account for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The end result of this process was a platform that was highly tailored to the needs of the end user whilst retaining the ability 
            to scale in the future.

          <p>
            At the time of writing, the initial delivery of the project to end-users/companies has just happened and the project is now being used 
            commercially.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plans for the future are therefore focused on gathering feedback, usage stats and having conversations with the users of PQ. With this information 
            we can cycle back to the start of the design process and informatively move forward with new features and improvements.
