            A study was developed
            to explore the usability
            of the current Supreme

          <p class="subheading-text">Study demographic</p>
          <p>
            Research found that the Supreme target demographic is mostly 16-35 year old males, but due to the unisex nature of their
            clothing and the rise of female skate culture they are starting to attract a wider female audience. The study demographic
            reflects these statistics.

            The scenarios were designed to replicate tasks which are likely to be commonly carried out by users on a the Supreme website, and
            therefore would give a more accurate insight into the usability of the website's core components.

            The data was compiled

          <div class="original-analysis">
            <p class="subheading-text">Task 1</p>
            <p>
              Task 1 was the task which had the highest completion time, averaged the most errors and also resulted in the most negative feedback from participants.
            </p>
            <div class="graph-key-container">

            <p>
              The main source of the problematic user experience was the page that users are greeted with when they navigate to the shop. The display, which
              appears to try and emulate a clothes rail, left participants not knowing how to find the item of clothing they were looking for and often resulted
              in confusion and semi-random clicking until progress was made.

            <p>
              The task of finding the returns policy was, on average, completed slightly faster than task 1 and with a slighty lower number of errors.

              The main problem with this task can be narrowed down to the terminology and grouping used in regards to page titles. Combining this with the
              fact the required information is below-the-fold, participants found it difficult to locate the info they needed - this led to a couple of participants even
              leaving the correct page as they didn't think it was right.
            </p>
            <div class="quotes">
              <p>
                <span class="speechmark">"</span>Went to terms first as I thought policies would be under there but it was actually under shipping information.<span class="speechmark">"</span>

              <p>
                <span class="speechmark">"</span>I opened the correct page and then left as it didn’t seem right.<span class="speechmark">"</span>

              <p>
                <span class="speechmark">"</span>I nearly gave up – I would normally have left the site and just Googled it.<span class="speechmark">"</span>

            </div>
            <p>
              Whilst analysing the path participants took to complete the task, it was discovered that there were multiple ways to get to the same information in 
              different locations - this redundant information only led to further confusion.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="original-analysis">
            <p class="subheading-text">Task 3</p>
            <p>
              Task 3 was the most 'successful' task of all. The completion time for most participants was a fraction of that recorded in previous tasks, with the 
              average being driven up by two outliers; these two outliers were also the only participants which made errors.
            </p>
            <div class="graph-key-container">
              <img src="images/task_graph_key.svg" class="graph-key">

            <p>
              The reason the two participants struggled was due to the lack of a universal navigation. If they missed the link on the homepage there was no way
              to get to the information they needed, and thus got stuck navigating in a web of irrelevant pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              The further comments show evidence of the above reasoning, but general sentiment was also much more positive than previously seen.

            A new website was

            <p class="subheading-text">General improvements</p>
            <p>
              Over 90% of people who took part in the initial study classed the readability of the text as ‘Very bad’ or ‘Bad’. 
              This feedback resulted in me increasing the font size from the original very small size to a more readable size. Relative size 
              comparison:
            </p>
            <div class="text-size-comparison">
              <p class="original">Original size</p>
              <p class="new">New size</p>
            </div>
            <p>
              On the existing website there is a large amount of wasted screen real-estate. I designed my new layout to utilise this 
              white space whilst mainting a simplistic and uncluttered aesthetic - largely achieved by increasing the size of the images.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="nav-redesign">

              <p class="subheading-text">Universal navigation</p>
              <p>
                One of the most notable complaints from the initial study was that there was no universal navigation menu which was always available.
              </p>
              <div class="quotes">
                <p>
                  <span class="speechmark">"</span>Had to navigate back to the home page to get to it.<span class="speechmark">"</span>
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                In order to solve this problem I designed a page layout which was consistent for every page on the
                site and included a navigation menu on the left hand side.
              </p>
              <p>
                This navigation menu never changes position and is never hidden. Such a design choice helps to reduce
                the number of clicks a user needs to perform in order to complete their task.
              </p>
            </div>

          <div class="shop-redesign">
            <p class="subheading-text">Redesigning the shopping experience</p>
            <p>
              By far the biggest source of complaints about the existing Supreme website was the confusing layout of the shop; poor user 
              experience was almost solely down to the unecessary and near-impossible to use view the user is initially presented with (as
              seen below).
            </p>
            <img src="images/original_shop.png">
            <p>
              As this page provides no value I chose to completely remove it from my redesign so the user is immediately presented with
              a more standarised shop view.
            </p>
            <p>
              The secondary navigation has been reworked so it is clearer what section the required information will be in. This means information 
              is more spread out and there is a much higher chance the desired information is above-the-fold and easy to find.
            </p>
            <img src="images/redesign_shop.png">
            <p>
              The final significant change to the shopping experience is the redesign of the basket.
            </p>
            <p>
              When at least one item is in the basket it will be visible at the bottom of the screen, shown as a full picture. Items can be removed 
              with a single click, without having to navigate into a more detailed ‘view basket’ page, and the total cost is clearly displayed 
              alongside a button to quickly checkout.
            </p>
            <img src="images/redesign_basket.png">
            <p>
              The basket is a persistent element on the screen regardless of where the user is on the site. Overall, this design choice
              streamlines the shopping experience and helps achieve the ultimate goal of the website - buying clothes.

            The same study (with the same scenarios) was carried out again, however this time the redesigned prototype was given to a new group of

                improvement still.

                Task 3 was the task with
                the best result in the
                original evaluation,
                but still saw significant
                improvement. On average it
                took 7s, had zero errors
                and required 2.1 clicks.

            On average, all three
            tasks were completed
            9.2x faster than in the
            original study.

            Each scenario/task had a question related to how difficult the participant found it to complete. Comparing the results
            from the retest (bottom scales) with the original evaluation (top scales) clearly shows that the redesign improved the
            user experience.

            The shift from a majority red to a majority green demonstrates that completing a range of common tasks has
            shifted from being difficult to easy thanks to the redesign.

                There was a significant reduction in the amount of ‘additional comments’, which can been seen as a great improvement from the vast amount
                of negative comments from the original evaluation.

              <p>
                By tallying up the sentiment of comments on both the original evaluation and redesign questionnaires it is clear how opinions changed. 
                Only 27% of comments on the original evaluation were positive, which is a big contrast to the 73% of positive comments on the redesign.

            There are a number of
            changes I'd like to make
            to this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the fact this project was a university assignment there were a few limitations which sculpted the way the studies were carried
            out.
          </p>
          <p class="subheading-text">Participant demographic limitations</p>
          <p>
            The number of participants we had to recruit was set in the specification and therefore only 12 people completed the first study, and 7 
            people completed the second study. Whilst the data collected is still perfectly valid and accurate, this is by far the most notable area 
            for improvement. If I were to conduct this study again I'd use a much larger sample size to get more representative results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the demographic could be tailored better to match the target audience of Supreme. A large proportion of the participants
            stated they had at least a small interest in online clothes shopping from niche brands, however nobody classed themselves as a 
            stereotypical Supreme fan.
          </p>
          <p class="subheading-text">A/B testing</p>
          <p>
            If I had more time and flexibility to carry out the study I would have liked to perform some form of A/B testing to compare how well
            different redesigns and/or design principles solved the problems from the initial evaluation.
          </p>
          <p class="subheading-text">Conclusion</p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, I would class the redesign and retest an overall resounding success, however the execution of the study could be improved 
            by making changes to the study demographic.
