            The market leading race review platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            With over 25,000 reviews for over 5000 events, Racecheck is the industry
            leading platform when it comes to authentic and honest event feedback for organisers and athletes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A streamlined mobile and desktop experience make discovering the best events easier than ever,
            whilst simultaneously providing organisers with an unbeatable platform for feedback and powerful
            marketing material.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer I worked on a range of significant projects to help
            build Racecheck into the go-to platform it is today. Below is a collection of features I delivered and experiences 
            I learnt from.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

            Designing and implementing an improved browsing experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each event on the Racecheck platform has its own dedicated race page. Here, users can learn
            all they need to know about the event, from organisational details to the opinions of the
            past-participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            With so much varied information being presented, it was vital to design these pages in such a way
            that the user could easily access the information they needed in an efficient manner whilst also
            making the browsing experience an enjoyable one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is a screenshot of the original race page header - a core component of the redesign.
          </p>
          <div class="wireframe-container">
            <img src="images/old_race_page.jpg">
          </div>
          <p>
            Some of the key issues I identified and the solutions I proposed were:
                <ul class="racecheck-ul">
                    <li><strong>Lack of information above the fold</strong> - this was solved by organising the most important event information
                    at the top of the page so the user could most likely get the info they needed at a glance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor accessibility/readability of text</strong> - seperating the image from the text not only makes the
                    information more readable, it also gives room for an engaging image gallery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Restrictive navigation</strong> - each section of the race page was previously housed in an individual 'page', which 
                    made it difficult check quickly check or reference information in different sections. To solve this problem I changed the structure 
                    of the race page so all information was in a single page, navigable via a secondary nav bar linked to scroll position.</li>
                </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            It was important to design the page in a modular and easily-expandable fashion due to the fact the fast-paced growth of the platform meant
            we were actively adding and removing components on a regular basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is a screenshot of the redesigned race page header.
          </p>

        <div class="section-content">

            <span class="racecheck-highlight">Racecheck Widget</span><br>
            Showcasing event reviews on organiser websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reviews are the single most powerful marketing tool for online purchasing - a fact that is equally prevalent in
            the events industry. Thousands of people rely on Racecheck reviews before planning their yearly race calendars and 
            equally organisers rely on reviews to plan and promote their upcoming events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to the launch of the Racecheck Widget there was no easy way for organisers to display their hard-earned reviews
            on their <i>own</i> website. A problem we set out to tackle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Racecheck Widget which I designed and built the frontend of is shown below.
          </p>
          <div class="wireframe-container rcw-animation-container">
            <object type="image/svg+xml" data="images/RCW-Animation.svg">svg-animation</object>
          </div>
          <p>
            The feedback from organisers in regard to the widget was overwhelmingly positive and helped determine how we progressed with future 
            updates and fixes.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="inner-section">
        <div class="section-content">
          <p class="large-text">
            <span class="racecheck-highlight">User research</span><br>
            An example of how user feedback shaped product direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reviews and the community are at the core of Racecheck. One project I worked on during my time at Racecheck focused on 
            the idea of enhancing how the community can interact with reviews posted by fellow athletes. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This product revolved around the premise of users being able to react to reviews to emphasise the points made for organisers 
            looking for feedback and help promote 'useful' reviews for others users. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After I created a number of mock-ups for the feature we presented them to a concentrated number of power-users for feedback. 
            Going into this process we wanted to determine which method of reaction was more understandble and ultimately provided the better 
            experience for users.
          </p>
          <div class="wireframe-container">
            <img class="review-reactions" src="images/review_reactions_v2.gif">
          </div>
          <p>
            The feedback we actually got was far more high-level and almost universally echoed complete negativity to the feature as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking this experience forward, we began presenting users with previews of new features much earlier on in the design process to gain initial 
            feedback and help determine the direction we would pursue. This was demonstrated during the design phase of the community discussion feature...
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            With over 25,000 lines of code committed and countless design iterations it would take too long to explain all of the features I worked on in depth.
